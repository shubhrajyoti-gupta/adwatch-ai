git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Approach

1. Frontend (Next.js) â†’ Deploy on Vercel

Fork or clone the repo.

In the root directory, check if thereâ€™s a Next.js app (likely in /client or root).

Push it to your own GitHub repo.

Go to Vercel Dashboard
.

Click New Project â†’ Import GitHub Repo.

Choose the repo â†’ Configure project:

Framework: Next.js (Vercel will auto-detect).

Build command: npm run build (default).

Output directory: .next.

Add required environment variables (e.g., API URLs for backend).

Deploy â†’ you get a https://your-app.vercel.app domain.

2. Backend (Flask API) â†’ Deploy Separately

Vercel doesnâ€™t support long-running Python APIs. Options:

Render.com (free tier) â€“ Easiest.

Railway.app / Heroku â€“ Good alternatives.

AWS / GCP / Azure â€“ If you need scale.

Steps (for Render as example):

Create a new repo with just the Flask backend code (/server folder).

Add requirements.txt and Procfile:

web: gunicorn app:app


Push to GitHub.

On Render
, create a Web Service, connect the repo.

Set runtime = Python 3.x.

Deploy â†’ you get https://your-backend.onrender.com.

3. Connect Frontend to Backend

In the Next.js frontend, update the API base URL:

const API_URL = "https://your-backend.onrender.com";


Add this as an environment variable in Vercel (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL).

Redeploy frontend.

4. Test Flow

Open frontend (Vercel URL).

Upload image / click detection â†’ API call goes to Flask backend.

Backend processes â†’ returns result.

Frontend displays violation info.

âš¡ End Result:

Frontend â†’ Vercel (fast, global edge deployment).

Backend â†’ Render/Railway/Heroku (Python API hosting).

They talk over REST API.
